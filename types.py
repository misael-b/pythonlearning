print(int("33"))

# changing variable types:
variable1 = 1
print("variable1 is of type", type(variable1))
variable1 = 'hello'
print("variable1 is of type", type(variable1))

# naming conventions:
#     Use only the characters 0-9, a-z, A-Z, and underscore. 
#     Do not start a variable name with a number.
#     Do not use keywords, which are words reserved by Python

# Operations:
print(2 + 3)
print(2 - 3)
print(2 * 3)
print(2 ** 3)
print(3 ** 2)
